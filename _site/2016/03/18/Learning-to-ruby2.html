<h1>Learning to Ruby</h1>
<p>March 18, 2016</p>
<p>When I first I started learning Ruby I thought it was a very strange language. Not necessarily the syntax of the language itself but rather the cultural conventions surrounding it. Rubyists have a very distinct style of doing things and seems to adhere very strong to that style.</p>

<p>I didn’t have any particular problems with the style, but rather had not experienced such a fervor in the other languages I had worked. Rubyists seems to stress very readable code, such that its almost always preferable for it to read as much as english as possible.</p>

<p>A good example of this is a simple guard clause to check for nil. Coming from other language my instinct was to write this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">bar</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In Ruby I quickly had to adapt to change this to</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">nil?</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Ultimately its a small difference but something about my personal style I had to change.</p>

<h5 id="enumerables">Enumerables</h5>

<p>Nothing demonstrates the ruby style like proper use of enumerables. When I first started learning I was resistant to them at first. The for and while loop were old friends, I was comfortable using them and didn’t see the need to memorize a giant handful of new loops.</p>

<p>Learning map was a good example of the usefulness of ruby enumerables. It was more convient and readable to write a quick map method on an array rather then the old style with a for loop I would have written.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">array</span>
  <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I could appreciate the elegance and simplicity of cutting the above down to</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But it wasn’t until I learned Reduce that I began to see the light. Reduce showed me the power and simplicity of enumerables and now I somewhat dreading moving to other languages like javascript where I will no longer be able to feel thier warm embrace.</p>

<p>Summing elements in an array is something I have found myself doing fairly frequently in programming. Previously I would have done so like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">array</span>
  <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">x</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With reduce:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  <span class="n">array</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">reduce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sum</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">sum</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>which seems like a small change, but is in my mind a large improvement over the way I used to do it. The best part about enumerables is how readable they make your code. Whenever I looked at a loop before learning Ruby, I would have to strain a bit to find out what that particular loop is doing. Comments were often necessary to explain the generic loop structure and bad variables name such as x, y, and i.</p>

<p>With Ruby I can look at a simple enumerable like reduce and know they they are probably summing a total of elements. Or I can look at sort_by and know they are sorting the array. Or I can look at select and instantly know they are creating a new array with elements that meet the block conditions.</p>

<p>Working on our latest project Black Thursday has made me curse ruby somewhat. I know our 90 second test suite would run in a fraction of the time if it was coded in something like C++.</p>

<p>But that curse is gone pretty quickly when I look at how readable and concise much of my code is because of the power of enumerables. I can step away from a long class and come back days later and easily reacquaint myself with is being done mostly just by reading what enumerables I used.</p>
